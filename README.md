CoreGPA.html  Download 
 

Your job will be to read the comments in the HTML file and create the appropriate HTML inputs to interact with the source code.

 

Use appropriate form controls for each of the inputs:

Overall GPA
Last 30 Credits GPA
Accounting 200 Grade
IS 201 Grade
IS 303 Grade
Essay score between 0 and 4
 

There should also be an HTML Label on the form to display the calculated GPA.

 

The Grade inputs should be a drop down list (i.e. A, A-, B+, etc.)

 

The Essay Score can be a drop downlist (select/option).

 

The others should be inputs that allow decimals.

 

Put a button on the HTML form with the text of "Calculate GPA".

 

Make sure you have appropriate comments. Only 1 PER GROUP should be uploaded.
